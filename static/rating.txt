Prices in Whistler actual for housing would be an issue so you would likely be living in Pemberton or down towards Squamish 
|
Squamish will give you the best value and is a nice compromise between being close to the mountains and the city. 
|
I've lived in all these places.

Kelowna was where I was born and raised so It has a special place in my heart. Kelowna is great year round in terms of activities and weather. Summer's it gets blistering hot and winter it stay's pretty tame with some snowfall. Nothing beats the Okanagan for summer activities. For skiing and snowboarding, Big White and Silverstar are only 45-60 mins away and you get to experience some of the best powder in BC. The fog can be a pain (Big White Out). Albertans come down and are  whoopsholes in the Summer. Renting is easy

Whistler is an endless playground with great communities for sports and activities. I found that it is very much a tourist town, and the friends you make there are usually there for a season or 2. I would also hate to raise a child there due to the risk of them getting involved in the party scene. Renting is tough to find a good rate here

Vancouver would be my recommendation as you are basically 20 mins from any outdoor activity, aside from the awful traffic the City has many great little communities to get involved in and the cuisine there is unmatched. Great camp sites and ski mountains very close to the city so you will not miss out on some quality skiiing (1.5hour drive to whistler). The weather there is the worst out of the 3 as it rains for majority of the year, July and August makes Vancouver worth it when you are on the spanish banks looking out at the harbour. Renting is easy dependent on whether you choose to be in the tri cities.
|
I don't think whistler in a rental would be the ideal place for a family with a young baby imo. It's a resort town. You'd be better looking at Squamish and Pemberton. I  whoopsume you've considered the amount of jobs in these areas and what is and isn't seasonal? You will find it very difficult to find rental accommodation during the ski season. What about somewhere like Coquitlam? More choice of jobs in Vancouver, greater amenities close by and not living in a resort environment, but yet not too far from whistler and then give grouse mountain as well in the city too. 
|
Squamish. It's exactly what you're looking for. Whistler has better restaurants, but it's nothing compared to Vancouver. You want to be closer to Vancouver. Squamish has amazing hiking and biking minutes from your door. I sometimes take a long lunch and go hike the chief. Whistler is 30-40 minutes away for skiing. Squamish is also packed with young parents.

I know you said you like the idea of being close to Whistler downtown, but I'm not sure why that it. Whistler is very touristy. You'll get bored of the village quickly and just end up eating at same places over and over because there aren't a lot of them. Also, I think amenities for a young family are significantly better in Squamish, high end restaurants not withstanding.
|
North Vancouver would be ideal. Tons of great elementary and high schools as well as the local mountains!
|
I live in Vancouver, but go to Whistler to snowboard a lot. I would suggest Whistler or Squamish based on what you have said about your interests. But Whistler first, of course.
|
I live in Vancouver, my parents have a place in Whistler and inlaws are in the Okanagan, Kamloops though but I have some insight for Kelowna.

Kelowna I know the least about but I go for a week most summers. It is a driving city with lots of traffic in the summer. The closest mountain is about an hour drive, Okanagan hills are generally less steep with less but very light fluffy snow. The areas around Kelowna are more arid and there is a lot more brown in the summer. If you want lush green nature Kelowna loses on the front, but you can find it. It also doesnt there have been fires recently, all areas were effected by smoke but I would guess Kelowna is more prone.

Whistler really depends on where you are but most likely if you are renting a house you'll be driving a bunch as well. Traffic on weekends can get insane. There are most likely very few young families to befriend in Whistler, squamish would be better for that. Whistler real estate is boom-bust and right now it's booming. If you want to buy in Whistler wait until the American dollar drops and you'll find it more affordable. Whistler is clearly the most outdoors accessible and that makes it busy in the winter and summer. 

Vancouver is transit friendly and walkable in the right neighbourhoods. You'll meet lots of young families as long as you put in the effort. There are also a lot of Irish people here if you are looking for a touch of home. It's an easy drive to the Whistler corridor but with a little kid it's a little more difficult. There are lots of good parks and hikes that can get you in touch with nature but they will be busy when the weathers good.

If you are really into coffee shops and cool restaurants Vancouver wins but Whistler has some great spots, my wife is addicted to pure bread. The places I've been to in kelowna, besides the wineries, have been sub par.

It's honestly a tough choice.
|
Where do you live in Ireland? Do you like where you live now? Are you looking for a change? What place is most similar to where you live now?
|
im booked for next week, been riding for 20+ years but never gone heli.  is it worth the $1000?  would you do it in whistler again?
|
People think these are getting a bit spammy, especially sub begging right in the title. Maybe space your submissions out a bit unless you have something particularly exciting or funny beyond the vlog-type update.
|
sorry to break it to you, but in whistler thats cl whoopsed as "sluff"

I have been totally buried inbounds (ruby chute) with a sz2 slide with 1.25m crown. 

the pressure to open the alpine its totally nuts. patrol are pushed to their limits. 

anytime the cloud clears and solar heating kicks in , and the situation changes.

good education video, but there is nothing that replaces a couple of buddies with avi equipment with you.

I like your vids, but just have a check out run before going to risky lines

This is from a guy with 14 whistler seasons (and more elsewhere) , and is typing with a broken leg in creekside right now.

give the mtn the respect, as it will bite you
|
Slush/ice at the lower runs?
|
Trying to plan for my Whistler vacation later this month.. Does the chest strapped go pro give the best forward viewpoint in your opinion?
|
I was at Whistler from 21st-26th....We got a lot of snow, but visibility on the peaks was not great. Maybe 4 hours total visibility at the peaks during our trip. However with that being said, Whistler is amazing and I cannot wait to come back...SO MUCH POWDER
|
Hey - you hopped on my lift today! I had to call ski patrol to get them to talk to you at the top - hope you managed to help them out in taking a look at the area
|
It's been bad for quite a few years now but you are not helping yourself coming in during the height of the season especially when there is actual snow. If you don't know people to crash with for a little while whilst you look around, maybe look into staying at the hostel towards cheekamus. Going into April/May you should find places free up as plenty of people bail out as winter ends 
|
You'll need to find housing before you get a job... It's pretty much the only criteria at the moment.
|
Sack off staff housing and find people to live with. So much more fun. 
|
> Do you have any recommendations for me? Is the housing crisis in Whistler still bad or has it settled down? I really don't know I'm hearing mixed reviews all over the internet.

Yes it is still bad.

Whistler Blackcomb has a TONNE of openings for jobs. They are short staffed for F&B staff (dishwashers, cooks, bussers) at most of the up mountain locations. Short on lifties, Tickets and Validators, Guest Services staff.

Usually short on cleaners, but it can be a desireable job due to non-guest facing, later job hours (more skiing during day).

A job isn't your problem. If you want a job and don't care what it is, you could have 5 by end of week.

WB Staff housing does have a large waiting list yes, but I am sure it will go down quickly from Feb onwards, many people leave town or quit.

Feb isn't really a great time tbh. You're relying on people leaving town for vacancies to open up. You will have more luck once you arrive in town, people with places to rent have the upper hand and 'ill give you a deposit when i get here in march' isn't a good strat for looking for a place.

No one wants to see this
|
Nice editing mate, looks like an awesome day! I get there next week from Australia, it’s been a dream of mine to go to Whistler for the last 10 Years or so. Hopefully the snow keeps falling the same way it has in the last week! 
|
Take the bus, I have a car and the bus is the only way I get around in the winter. Drops you right at the base, and it takes about 4 minutes from Nordic. Just Google Whistler Bus Riders guide and you will get the full schedule. 
|
Bicycle
|
Very easy to find parking at Base 2. But if you don’t want to drive, you can take the bus or taxi
|
There are 4 bus stops in Nordic. 

1 just off Highway 99 at the Northern-most Nordic entrance.

1 just at the base of Nordic drive.

1 most of the way down Eva Lake Road.

Final one just near Rimrock entrance, at the southern-most Nordic Entrance.

Buses will come every 20 minutes. 

The 20, 21 and 25 will all stop in Nordic going South, and stop at the same places going North. The 20X will skip Nordic going South but you can catch it on the highway going North.

The cost is $2.50 per trip, but you can get a book of tickets from the Visitor Center or the Grocery store that makes it a bit cheaper.

The bus going North, the last stop (before it goes back south again) is right next to the Excalibur Gondola, a very short walk to the Whistler Village Gondola.

Pay Parking is available in Lot 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. $10 a day in the first 3, $5 a day in the latter two. Lots 6, 7, 8 are at Base II and higher up Blackcomb Mountain are free. That early you should be able to find free parking without issue.

https://bctransit.com/whistler/home

If there's 4 or more of you I'd just call a cab. From Nordic to Village will be $10, and saves you a sketchy walk down Nordic Drive hill.
|
Thanks. Driving will probably be the best way. Couldn't remember just how much parking there was. 
|
Very helpful! Thank you. 
|
I took the whistler taxi every day I was there for this, no problems just give yourself enough time.
|
We ended up driving from Nordic drive & parking in lot #1. Only $10CAD for all day & it's a short walk to the Village Gondola. 
|
If you're by yourself, the whistler shuttle is your best (and cheapest) bet. Google whistler shuttle, and you can reserve a ride. It's $60 each way, you enter your flight info, they monitor your flight, and will adjust depending on flight delays.

They need a 3 day lead time I believe as well. 
|
[Here](https://www.whistler.com/getting-here/road/shuttle/) is a page that has a couple shuttle options. 
The first two are easiest as the leave from the airport.  The last one is cheapest, but you'd have to make your way downtown (about $15 on the train)

edit: looking into it further, the SkyTrain fare to downtown would be $9.10. 
|
Airport to Whistler

Pacific Coach
Whistler Shuttle

Vancouver Downtown(ish): Get on the sky train, pay $4 I think, take the train for 15 minutes. It goes straight to the Greyhound terminal (might need to change trains) or just go downtown.

Greyhound
Epic Rides

These are cheaper, but you know. You gotta get there!

Cheapest:

www.poparide.com

Facebook group Hitching the Sea to Sky

https://www.facebook.com/groups/hitchingseatosky/

Can be hit or miss, I drive people all the time. You might have more luck from downtown than from YVR, but again that's a $4 train ride from the airport. (Station is right outside the airport). Obviously con is you're trusting someone to take you, and they could bail or you just not find a ride but poparide has a feedback option. 



|
$30 the greyhound to Whistler. 
|
Depending on how long you're staying, just renting a car might not be a bad option. I just looked into it for a weekend in march and it was $85 US for a Thursday evening pickup and Monday morning drop off. 

If you do that, don't forget to factor in the cost of gas in BC and your comfort with driving in winter conditions. 
|
When the Saddle is groomed, the only way to go is straight down.

Rented boards for 8 years, finally bought my own setup (bataleon goliath 2018 w/ Burton cartels)

Can anybody id this jacket? https://imgur.com/a/tj2Pi
|
What's the next bit of gear you're planning to buy, and why that brand/model? 

For me, next up is boots (not sure on model, gotta find a good fit) probably ride or flux.
|
Is it just me or is the Olympic commentary absolutely woeful? Watching slope style and all they seem to be able to do is count spins and mispronounce names.
|
I'm a newish snowboarder guy that's been renting for the past 5 years looking to get my own board and bindings. I already have a pair of boots (best purchase I've ever made the rentals always killed my feet) but I'm looking into a K2 Subculture with K2 Indy bindings. I'm a bit bigger of a guy (5' 9" at 240 lbs, also only a size 9 boot). Do you guys/gals think this board will suit me? Looking at the 161. I mostly just like to go fast but wouldn't be opposed to hitting a few parks here and there. Also any helmet recommendations? 
|
Looking to make first purchase and was looking at a Ride Crook 155. I’m 5’ 11” roughly 245. Is 155 too small or would I have problems with it?
|
I currently ride a libtech Travis rice pro 161.5. Looking for a more playful park/butter board, any recommendations? Currently considering the huck knife, evil twin, and funslinger.

Around 190ish lbs if that matters.
|
Two questions for today. 
1) I’m on my second year with burton concord boots which are a dual boa boot. I generally only tighten the lower zone enough to take the slack out of the cables and the upper zone I tighten till they are snug. Recently I’ve noticed a slight heel lift in the left boot(regular footing). Is this due to my loose bottom portion or should I be tightening the upper portion more?

2) I recently built up the confidence to try and do some small jumps and noticed when I did them, maybe 50% of the time I was thrown forward. Not to the extent that I was flying through the air but to the point that I seemed like I was landing on the nose slightly. Is this me not being used to aerial maneuvers or am maybe leaning to far forward on take off. 


|
Thinking about buying a new board. I mainly ride all mountain/resort; groomers, trees, moguls but not any park. Right now I'm on a Lib Tech 164 Dark Knife. Love the board on groomers and soft packed but whenever I get into any powder I tend to sink. I know keeping up my speed would help but I'd rather add another board to my quiver that would be a more enjoyable ride in the trees and is a bit more playful. 

I like Mervin boards but I'm not opposed to other brands. I wear a 12.5 Salomon Synapse Focus boot with Union Atlas bindings. Was thinking about checking out a Gnu Rider's Choice in a wide. Anyone have any suggestions?
|
Pretty new snowboarder here buying my first board. Considering a used Burton Hero I found on Craigslist. 

Is [this damage on the nose](https://imgur.com/a/Gx3fW) going to mess me up or is it just aesthetic?

Also, is the Burton hero a good board to start with? It looks like it's a good all mountain board and pretty good on jumps and jibs, which is what I'm looking for. Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything
|
I'm looking to get my first board in the coming months. I am still new so I am not positive on what area I want to focus on yet. My boots are the Burton Moto Boas size 14, I think that is = to 13 in other brands. So I need a wide board, I am 6'2 and go around the 195-210 Lbs range. Any recommendations?

Edit: Also need bindings, have been thinking about the Union Force. Any recommendations for Bindings?
|
Question about left lower back fatigue:

I can't ride switch yet, so I'm always looking over my left shoulder and my torso is turned down the mountain to the left. Eventually I get extremely fatigued in the left side of my lower back towards my hip. It isn't a pain or anything...I can just feel that it's so tired and the feeling is very present if that makes any sense. While I'm toeside, I try to keep my shoulders parallel with my board, but the runs I'm on aren't usually wide or have man-made moguls, so I do have to eventually turn my shoulders to the right to see upcoming bumps and get back to heelside fairly quickly. Does anyone know why this happens to me? I'm generally athletic and I was a power lifter for 2 years if that's relevant.
|
Hey guys! I currently ride an Arbor A-frame and was looking for a more playful board when I ride with my girlfriend. It would be for practicing my switch riding, buttering and goofing around.

Any thoughts / preference on Libtech Skate Banana, Yes Basic, K2 Raygun or anything else that's playful?

Happy ridin!

I'm getting old- 48. I only owned 1 board since 1996. A Burton Floater. I just laid it on my floor and it has a slight camber bend. I had to get new boots and bindings because the old ones fell apart from age. I figured it was time to get a new board too. 25 years on one board means I got my money's worth. I ordered a Burton Custom 158wide to accommodate my size 12 feet. Now I am having doubts. It is a camber board but more stiff than my old flexing floater. Also I have never sharpened my edges in maybe 20 years. I am scared that the first time I try this new camber board I am going to catch the side edge and break my ribs.  I'm a casual carver who never does the parks. I'm a dad who rides with my little skiing girls and wife. Should I have gotten a flat board or the Custom flying V instead?  Or should I just file down the sharp edges like I read some people do for beginners?  I'm not a beginner but I'm forever an intermediate who is just getting old and fearing I might not tip my edges up as much as I used to.  Thanks in advance for any advice, boader pros!
|
Is padding worth it? I'm new to snowboarding and got a set of wrist guards, but my friend told me I should look into getting some padding for my butt.
|
Does anyone know what board this is? A friend of mine wants to know if I want to take it off her hands since she got it for free by taking it from her boyfriend's mountain house or whatever. 

I don't want to spend money on it if it isn't that great of a board. I can tell it's a Ride, but that's it.

Are we in 3018?

This was so awesome to watch, I can’t imagine the praise the team who pulled it all off are getting and the raise whoever’s idea it was!! 
|
Was waiting for it to say send nudes... someone get on this... all the karma will be yours.

This is pretty rad

That was awesome. They should've had more drones loaded with cameras I think

Mad

Just watched that part on TV is pretty impressive!

When I first saw this gif I thought it was crazy that they went through all the sports!

Nope....just snowboarding! ya boys

I kinda feel bad that they actually like these suits, must be hard for them seeing how good the canucks look.
|
What's with the us team and the pants buckled below their  whoopses? Doesn't that affect performance? Isn't that idiotic style about 5 years past it's best-before date?

I note the US athletes went 1 for 4 qualifying while my fellow canucks went 4/4. Score 4:1 for Siwash jackets vs pants around the knees. 
|
Holy smokes.


Coming up at 27 now, guess there's still hope for doubles!
|
lol. I'm nearly 40 now and decided its time to land a backflip.

|
Filthy, man. 


|
Damn dude, well done! The suspense of not knowing if you landed it for that couple seconds after is well worth it too. Camera guy/chick picked a sweet spot 
|
I'm 43 and on day 9 of this snowboarding melarky.  There's time?
|
Sick man
|
Clean!
|
Noice!!!!!!!
|
There's still hope! Not quite doubles but here's my 45 year old buddy throwing down https://streamable.com/q0bww
|
Gnarly bro, my dads 55 and still goin strong, u got plenty more time. Sick trick tho!
|
I'm 47. I'm happy if I get to the bottom without falling over.
|
LOL i recognize this video, UCI board club? I didn't realize you were almost 40 though...
|
Daaamn I through a backflip like that too for years but never had the balls to go for a double lol on a jump that size do you just huck it and hope for the best. I feel like you don't have too much time to spot your landing
|
olderboi does a flip x 2
|
Craig McMorris is the hero we truly need
|
All the one guy can talk about is what stance the riders are it’s so annoying
|
I nearly died when the one guy didn't know what a speed check was.  Then during the same run he acted like he had always known and how dare that rider for doing it.  

On a side note that rail section contains some of the most WTF am I supposed to do with this features I have ever seen.  I do love the angled jumps though.   
|
They are awful. Literally all they know about snowboarding is stance and spins. No mention of corks or anything like that
|
Need to get yourselves some BBC commentators, they mentioned his bindings coming off
|
Holy  whoops. Not giving any credit to the riders. Just being super nitpicky on the smallest things. This guy sounds like he’s never snowboarded a day in his life but talked to the judges 20 min before this. 
|
Want Craig McMorris instead? Get yourself over to olympics.cbc.ca. It might be region locked but you can work your way around that, you have over an hour to figure it out for heat 2.
|
Both commentators in the US are awful!  Is the color guy the one that keeps counting rotations?  One of them might be British?  The other guy learned the term "switch" and how to identify an "old school" method right before film.  And he just called a step down a "down flat down".

As I'm watching this McLallen just threw a corked 10 mute and all we got was "that's 3 spins".
|
I heard them say a rider’s run was significantly hurt because he speed checked...... SPEED CHECKED 🤦♂️
|
The bbc guys are pretty great, they certainly talked about the binding. 
|
BBC guys are great, they know their stuff and they're keeping it very light hearted. Definitely worth getting a VPN and getting on the BBC streams
|
Haha I came here to start this thread love you guys.. and they were ragging on riders for coming off early on that first rainbow, which they are clearly doing on purpose to catch that transition then gapping to the other rail.  Called a switch backside spin cab. It’s killing me
|
The Canadian ones aren’t great either, but at least we got a play by play of the Finnish coach knitting at the top. 
|
 whoops yeah man!  Such a fun trick.  Keep on sending it!
|
Nice Man! How did you go about learning a spin/flip like This? I'm already nervous enough when it comes to just spinning, I can't imagine trying to throw so flipping in there
|
Rodeos are my favorite trick to watch! As I'm old and I can't do them :(


 But that was sick!!!
|
Dope! 
|
Aye this at roundtop PA ? Local to that spot myself. 
|
Shoutout to rmr
|
I always read titles like this as bull whoops Rodeo. And then I watch the video and think, no, that's not bull whoops. That was really nice.
|
Nice man! I hit roundtop/whitetail almost every weekend!
|
That’s sick man wish I could do it 
|
Nice!  It already looks pretty good.  A dozen more days doing it and everyone will wonder how you make it look so easy and clean.
|
Ayye u be flexing up liberty too lol
|
You doing the contest this Saturday at RT?
|
Yeah Roundtop! That’s where my school had ski club 
|
 whoops I wish my mountain had a night park, 3:30 is way too early for me. I'd love to take a break and then just hit features and drink beers for hours.
|
Nice one dude. Looks old school and flippy like they should be. Send it off the bigger side they are way easier when you don't have to Chuck as hard. Just let it roll. Good style!
|
Damn you got so much additional air off your pop, thought you were going slow at first. Nice!
|
We have Craig McMorris in Canada, so no issue here. You should try to get a Canadian stream. Might be region locked but that can be worked around. olympics.cbc.ca
|
Yes. Goofy foot rider btw
|
"Ohh a hand touch, judges won't like that" "He's not goofy, so hes going the right direction now" "1, 2, 3, and half spins, thats a 1260"... Such boring commentating. 
|
I just bought a vpn so I could tune in to CBC. I couldnt take the pain anymore
|
The Australian ones are decent
|
Ed leigh commentator for the BBC is pretty good. 
|
They keep saying it over and over... that difficult to come up with even a little variation  in commentary? 
|
BBC guys are great, definitely worth getting a VPN and getting on their streams
|
You have to remember this is a reletively new sport in the Olympics and people may be watching who aren't familiar with the sport, they're over explaining everything for those potential new viewers

Edit: I was watching craig mcmorris in Canada I can't comment on who you were watching
|
I’m just glad that they’ve improved since the days of calling anything “stunts” and “aerials” and “360* rotations” of the first few olympics of halfpipe.   whoops if it doesn’t irk me when they still say “amplitude” though,  whoops isn’t a sine wave homie.
|
Depends where you are.  Canada has Craig Mcmorris, we good.
|
I'd def crash into that gondola
|
Methods are awesome. However, imo methods look kinda weird on straight airs. Nice air 
|
I’d totally clip the gondola and go head first into the edge of the jump 
|
Great video! What stance are you riding, Ryan? 
|
r/mildlyinfurating that I started watching at the end of the first heat, NBC said I only had 5 minutes to watch, and 80% was commercials while 20% was shots of the crowd. Luckily I was able to copy-paste the url in an incognito tab and keep watching!
|
i've tried on tramps but i have no idea when i will ever dare trying that on actual snow
|
Nice flip. It's a backflip tho. Underflip would be taking that to switch.
|
Warning.  Loud.


 whoops


You
|
Jesus dude I had my headphones off and I still heard it through them.
|
I'm ready to hop on this bandwagon... where can we get some Donek Ski Poles? Send me a link /u/RyanKnapton
|
I was teaching a friend how to snowboard 10 years ago and brought along a set of poles for his first day. They were so damn handy, and I didn't care whether it looked cool. I saw an instructor at Heavenly do it for years growing up (credit to Doug, hope you're still rocking that 90s stache).

I've only grabbed them when teaching friends and family, and even then for only part of a day. Pretty handy for a lot things. You can stay standing comfortably in most places, and you'll be stopping a lot depending on how many times the new rider falls. Pointing out where to go on a hill. Staking them into a makeshift hazard sign behind a new rider if they fall below a hill lip where incoming traffic is sketchy. For cat tracks I would just hand the newbro the sticks and get them back at the end.
|
So... would having poles with me actually help me get across flats?
|
Tried snow blades one drunken night, was fun
|
Yep
|
Anyone here that doesn’t board or ski? Hard to when you live in the south. :(
|
Yeah, I do both. Learned boarding first, was already at an "expert" level (hitting big booters, rails, spins), picked up skiing in like one day, throwing 3's in the park and stuff. I prefer being on a board but once I got into the backcountry and on a splitboard I found it so much faster and easier to skin on skis. I still split lines that I wanna ride on really good pow days but for slackcountry and warmer days I'll ski.
|
I do up hill.
|
Sure
|
*raises hand*

Not as good as I snowboard, but I co-coach lessons to adaptive skiers because it's frowned upon for the snowboarders to not know how to ski since there are  whoops ton more skiers than snowboarders.
|
I picked up skiing two years ago and love it
|
Yes. I actually learned to how to snowboard and ski at the same time, but I guess if you have to split hairs day one was skiing. I was very young so my memory is a little fuzzy. It was this short lived little hippy ski and snowboard camp for like 4-7 year olds in South Lake Tahoe in the early 90s. No idea if they still do that, but I had a blast.

I haven't in a few years and I'm 32 now. But the last time I skied I challenged myself to learn to ride switch decent enough for some jumps into or out of in the park. Picked that up fast and it is quite fun. I can't think of many reasons for anyone not to learn to ski. I snowboard 90% of the time. Have some friends that like Deer Valley. Wish I could board on that mountain.

Skiing is easy to learn. This may just be me, but I'll never feel comfortable in the air like I do on a snowboard. Even when I've been at my best and able to 180 and 360, it scared the  whoops out of me every time I was airborn. On a snowboard even when I screw up and I'm in the air about to crash I feel like I have a little more control.

I would probably say Copper. They usually have 2 for 1 deals at local gas stations, but I'm not exactly sure about lodging down there. It can't be more expensive than any of the Vail Resorts. 
|
You could stay in Dillon or keystone and go to A Basin. Not too far down the road. I think season p whoops holders at Copper get a few half off p whoopses for friends. Also, Vail Resort employees get a small number of half off p whoopses for friends. You have to know someone in both cases to get them unfortunately.

Bogus is really easy to get to from Boise. It has some good mixes of terrain and difficulties, with a lot of area to explore. 

Be aware that snow conditions have not been ideal this season, and as of this last weekend, it was late spring type conditions. There was a lot of slush/running water. Several runs were scraped to dirt in the center.
|
Tuesday. 

There is no "better" weekend day. Flip a coin. 
|
I prefer Sunday. Traffic getting up there is better and if you stay until last chair and grab apres, traffic should have died down getting back (barring weather or accidents). Plus the mtn clears out more as the day goes on due to vacationers and weekenders trying to beat the traffic.

Saturday is usually crazy getting up, busy on the hill, and still some traffic getting back.

That said, /u/Dvanpat is right.
|
can you please stop posting these dumb whoops videos. 

I actually thought he might try it on the top to keep snow from sticking and keep it light, but no... of course not. As soon as I saw who's video it was I knew it was going to suck.

I find it funny the skiers are downvoting that topic, PURELY because i listed the resorts which are skier only with a "-" symbol 
|
What size are you? I have a set of Ride Orions in size 10.5 from back in the day. light use. This run big. I am a 11.5 in most boots.  $20 shipped. waaaay too soft for me.

I hear the Vans Hi-standard boots are supposedly very soft/flexible. I have them in a 13 and find them to be very comfortable.
|
Not sure if Burton still makes them but the Moto is a pretty soft boot, I definitely toed the line of breaking my ankles a few times in them. Still have 'em if you're interested.
|
Thanks for all the comments. I'm starting to think that no one currently makes what I'm looking for and will probably have to buy some used boots. 

The Burton Stumpys from 2007 are advertised as being a 1/10 for stiffness. Unfortunately I wear a size 14 shoe so I will have to find a 13 or 14 and they are already super difficult to find in the first place. I like the idea of a boot that isn't too old as I would like a decently small foot print. 

Luckily I should be getting a new board in the mail in a few days that is custom, so I designed it to be wider than anything on the market. 

Being a tall old schooler puts me in a situation where it is very difficult to find things I like to ride.

Does anyone know a good place to buy old gear? I haven't been able to even find Stumpys on ebay. I'm thinking about trying to get Burton to go through an old warehouse for me at this point.

i’ve thought about this with some dunes not too far away during the summer, it looks like a blast, definitely seeing this renews my interest hmmm

Yeah it's not super beginner friendly for boarders, most of the learner slopes have drag lifts which probably isn't a good idea for someone who's a complete beginner. Savoy has a magic carpet to start on, but you'd want to be moving on from that fairly soon, and there's just drag lifts there too. I remember there's some easy slopes up in Brevent /Flegere with chair lifts so that might be a go. Maybe head over to Courmayeur, it's on the other side of the tunnel about half hour away, and I think it's a bit more beginner friendly, but do some reading up first.

Yo I sent you a message!
|
Hard for me to say without seeing the size of the van, but if it is too tight you could always take off the bindings of all the boards so you can stack them together. That would save you a ton of space 
|
If the minivan has pilot seats, what you can do is place the board with the bindings facing in, slide them between the door and the pilot seats. 
|
Rent a Thule box if you can. Will give you so much more space. 
|
I can think of two options. 

SCS shopping mall with stores like Intersport, Hervis, Blue Tomato, XXL Sports..
